### About me

The tool has 2 conditions:

Monitor modes- for x time that the user chooses the machine checks which services stop running or start running compare to the last check.

Manual mode- the user inserts 2 dates that he want to compare between. the tool print which service no longer run or start running.

The tool is cross-platform that means it works on Windows and Linux.
